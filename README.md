## About me
Hello, my name is Devin Deal! ðŸ™‚ I recently graduated from community college, so this is my first semester at university. 
I have a growing passion for learning how to become a better software developer. 
I really enjoy playing video games, reading a good book, and also spending free time learning new languages. 
By that, that includes both programming, as well as real-world languages.
